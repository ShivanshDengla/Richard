Thanks for being so supportive now, before and likely in the future! Seems you always have the right attitude and motivation to inspire others. When you just out of nowhere offered me a free phone it really re-invigorated my interest and spark in contributing to the Ethereum space! ;Andy;https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=16NGcN12g5iTA50lAupdxmuMVwsqy6Qqx

Listening to Richard tell a story is like opening a box of chocolates on Valentine's day. You never know what kind of treasure you're about to bite into, but you're going to enjoy whatever it is. Happy Birthday buddy!;DaBoom;
Richard has been a great friend since the very beginning, even without knowing me. I wish him double the good he does for everyone. You are the best Richard!;Nahuel;

"Richard! You are one of the most kind, thoughtful, driven, and unique people I've met in this space. We need more Richards! You karate chop the idea of risk-averse in the face (nfa, DYOR), a bullishness I see as a reflection of your conviction in Crypto and the community behind it. 

I barely knew you and you changed my life this past year. Thank you for encouraging me to use Juicebox to raise funds for my car. In retrospect, that was a trigger event that brought so much positivity and bravery into my life. A few weeks later, I applied to ConsenSys. I had eyed the job before but didn't believe I was 'cut out' for it. Bro, I am literally the puzzle piece that fits into that job, that's how cut out for it I am. I took a powerful community to prove that to me.  

I'm starting my new position as Senior Copywriter at ConsenSys on January 31st :) 

Keep being you. There are other Livsters out there who need you, and your impact on me will allow me to be a Richard to those new Livsters with so much talent, but so little belief in themselves. 

Happy Birthday!!";Livster;https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1s12hTW3E7mxhf53KFWn0kz6Yj7eG2kuP
I don't know where to start! Thank you for always elevating others, be it through direct help, your ability to connect with others, or simply with humor. Your positive attitude is contagious and you must be the kindest heart I know. One thing is sure - PoolTogether would not be the same without you. Happy Birthday, Richard!;Tjark;https://drive.google.com/u/0/open?usp=forms_web&id=1wZnbJ8yQxFHb4ZmHdLWreVZ_uuJ0kJVP
